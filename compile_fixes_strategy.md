# Summary of Fixes

1. Removed duplicate method declarations in MoodStore.swift by delegating to StrategyEffectivenessStore
2. Added helper class StrategyEffectivenessStoreHelper to hold properties that can't be in an extension
3. Made all the strategy-related methods in StrategyEffectivenessStore the primary implementation
4. Clarified method ownership by adding 'primary implementation' comments
5. Created a wrapper for stored properties instead of trying to declare them in an extension
