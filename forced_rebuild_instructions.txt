# Complete Clean and Rebuild Instructions

After running the complete_rebuild.sh script, follow these additional steps to ensure a complete rebuild:

1. Close Xcode completely

2. Open Terminal and run these commands (replacing paths as needed):
   ```
   cd /Users/sayedmohamed/Desktop/ResilientMeSwiftFixed/ResilientMe
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
   xcrun -k
   ```

3. Restart your Mac (this is important to clear any caches)

4. After restarting, open Xcode and go to:
   - File > Open
   - Navigate to your project
   - Select Digitalrejection/ResilientMe.xcodeproj
   - Click "Open"

5. In Xcode:
   - Select Product > Clean Build Folder (Shift+Command+K)
   - Wait for the clean to complete
   - Select Product > Build (Command+B)

6. If the build fails with the same error:
   - Create a new Xcode project (File > New > Project)
   - Select iOS App template
   - Save it somewhere
   - Copy all Swift source files from your current project to the new one
   - Add necessary frameworks and resources
   - Build the new project

The steps above force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch, which should resolve linking issues related to macOS object files.
